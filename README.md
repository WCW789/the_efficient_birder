# The Efficient Birder

(README in progress)

The Efficient Birder is an online birding journal that will automatically fill in information based on an image upload. A user can also view a list of the birds they've seen.

Adding in new entries of birds seen involves manual work that could be bypassed. By effectively utilizing image recognition functionality, birders can avoid typing or writing in information and instead have relevant details automatically populated for them.
